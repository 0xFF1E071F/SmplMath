07.08.2011: Version 1.0.2
            improvement: ldl-macro now supports [TEXT]EQU's

27.08.2011: Version 1.0.3
            added: min/max functions

12.09.2011: Version 1.0.4
            the mod-function was not documented and noted in math_functions.inc

27.10.2011: Version 1.0.5
            > bug fix: in fSlvSetPrecision
            > some corrections in documentaion
            > unicode.inc: - all macros redesigned
                           - CWSTR renamed to WCSTR
                           - cwsz$ renamed to wcsz$

20.11.2011  Version 1.0.6
            added: R4/8/10 macros

21.11.2011  Version 1.0.7
            bugfix:      Because of a misconception of the @ScanForFlt()-macro, 
                         expression could be parsed incorrectly (->tmt_check_for_single_argument)
                         This was also a problem in some other macros.
            improvement: @ScanForFlt() -> "blanks"-keyword added

13.12.2011  Version 1.0.8
            bugfix:      - GPRs fails for functions with one argument (->fslv_call_fnc)
                         - The Smplmath-includes can't be used for modular programing
            improvement: If __MODULE__ is defined, the SmplMath-includes does not create code or
                         constants. Instead EXTERNDEFs and PROTOs are used.This is needed for 
                         modular programing. Example:
                         ...
                         __MODULE__ TEXTEQU <>
                         include \macros\SmplMath\math.inc
                         ...

04.01.2012  Version 1.0.9
            bugfix:      BYTE-registers (AL,AH,CL,...) were treated as unsgined values.
            added:       - @fSlvTSA()-macro: preliminary version, not documented
                         - new include file: macro.inc , preliminary version, not documented

17.01.2012  Version 1.0.10
            bugfix:      r8IsValid() fixed
            misc:        examples modified

20.01.2012  Version 1.0.11
            added:       - atan2 function
                         - pop-Attribute
                         - free-Attribute
            improvement: FPU registers can be used as destination operand
